
# Products-Domain 🛒 - Microservices for Product Management 🔧

## 📦 Project Overview

**Products-Domain** is a collection of microservices built using **Python** designed for handling product-related functionalities in an e-commerce platform. This repository contains services for managing product reviews, shopping cart operations, and fetching product reviews. These microservices work together to provide a seamless product management experience.

### 🚀 Main Features:
- **Cart Service**: Handles the shopping cart functionality, allowing users to add, remove, and view products in their cart.
- **Get Review Service**: Allows users to fetch existing reviews for products.
- **Review Service**: Allows users to submit reviews for products.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍: The primary language used for building the microservices.
- **Flask** 🖥️: A micro web framework used to build the APIs for the services.
- **Docker** 🐳: Containerization of the microservices for easy deployment and scalability.

## 🔍 Repository Structure

Here’s a quick overview of the folder structure in the repository:

```
├── .github/workflows/  - GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD 🚀

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This set of microservices is designed to manage the product domain for an e-commerce platform. The services allow for:
- **Cart Management**: Users can add and remove products from their cart.
- **Review Management**: Users can read and write reviews for products.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Cart Service**: Manages the cart state and operations like adding/removing items. Exposes APIs that communicate with the product catalog.
2. **Get Review Service**: Fetches reviews from a database or another external service, allowing users to view product feedback.
3. **Review Service**: Accepts new reviews from users and stores them for later retrieval.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- Integration with product search 🛍️
- Admin interface for managing products and reviews 🖥️
- Improved scalability with message queues or event-driven architecture 🚀
